<h1 class="title">History</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-text">March 2020:</span> Initial work on this application began.
    It evolved over the course of the year to be of potential use to other developers
    of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-text">November 2022:</span> Additional checks were added to
    eliminate duplicate sequence and variant records.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-text">January 2023:</span> Functionality was added to automatically
    align newly-added primer sets to the genome to reduce overhead and prevent errors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-text">May 2023:</span> The data source was switched from GISAID to NCBI GenBank.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-text">June 2023:</span> Lineage calling is now performed on all
    new sequences using Pangolin. In addition, all existing sequences are re-called periodically
    to ensure newly-classified lineages are reflected properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-text">July 2023:</span> The previous static lineage variants images have
    been replaced with an interactive igv.js visualization that updates from the database daily,
    showing which primers are likely affected by variants for a selection of potentially-interesting
    lineages.
  </li>
</ul>

  This tool remains a work in progress and under active development. Future changes will be added to this list as they are released.
