To add a lineage:
 - align representative sequences from a new lineage
 - call variants
 - prepare bed file containing variants and primers in tracks for each lineage
 - split bed into individual bed files by track (split_bed_by_track.sh)
 - intersect lineage bed files with primer bed files (calc_intersects.sh)
 - update visualization and publish to tableau public
